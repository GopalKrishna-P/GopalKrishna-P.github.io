### [Bachelor Thesis Project : Fault Diagnosis of Centrifugal Pumps using Machine Learning](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtlAOL70F67mtCXTaZ?e=dgGgjq)
_Prof. Rajiv Tiwari, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Aug 2018 - Mar 2019_
* Employing different Deep Learning techniques for classifying data acquired from fault specific harmonic components vibration signals, line current, pressure, acoustic emission through sensors attached to the centrifugal pump.
* The proposed algorithm may be employed for condition based monitoring in industrial equipment reducing human engagement in real-time fault detection and decision making.

### [Autonomous Water Sprinkler for Robotic application](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtk324mQlLS3XwNDf1?e=SntdsF)
* Developed a robot with a single sprinkler and water storage than can move through rough agricultural terrain.
* Navigation is done through Geo-fencing sensors to cover large areas without manual intervention.

### [Automated Wheelchair](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtk39kg0oiiR-3Umoa?e=Xa4quK) & [Adaptive Escalator](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtk3sSrnKSavn3JWL3?e=VzWEaJ)
_Prof. Sashindra K. Kakoty, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Jan 2016 - Mar 2016_
* Designed a cost efficient and light weight wheel chair model to climb stair case.
* Followed Machine Design Framework as taught by _Prof. S.K Kakoty_ in designing the conceptual model for the product.
* Evaluation of the concept was done by developing CAD model with Solidworks, ADAMS for statis analysis.

### [Vibrational Analysis of Hybrid Engine](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtlAD1V8r2XZ7TqCG_?e=ZdviPg)
_Prof. S.K Dwivedy, HOD, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Oct - Nov 2017_
* Analysed and developed a mathematical model for Hybrid vehicles with IC and Electrical engines running in parallel.
* Developed a 3D Half-Car Model and stimulated its performance using ADAMs. 

<br/>

### [Dynamic Analysis of a Crane](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtlAFi4_esSBHhLi8q?e=1CqVmf)
_Prof. S.K Dwivedy, HOD, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Nov 2017_
* Developed a mathematical model and analysed different configurations with constant spring stiffness and damping (Under Damped)
* Verified the same using simulations in ADAMS.
