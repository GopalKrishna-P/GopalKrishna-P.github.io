    "<h2>Bachelor Thesis Project : Fault Diagnosis of Centrifugal Pumps using Machine Learning</h2>
    <p><em>Prof. Rajiv Tiwari, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Aug 2018 - Mar 2019</em></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Employed different Deep Learning techniques for classifying data acquired from fault specific harmonic components vibration signals, line current, pressure, acoustic emission through sensors attached to the centrifugal pump.</li>
      <li>The proposed algorithm may be employed for condition based monitoring in industrial equipment reducing human engagement in real-time fault detection and decision making.</li>
