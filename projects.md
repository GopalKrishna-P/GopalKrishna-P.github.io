* Implemented backpropagation, normalization, dropout and CNN.
* Implemented RNNs for image captioning on Microsoft COCO.
* Implemented a GAN to generate images that match a training dataset.

<br/>

### [Pint OS](https://github.com/GopalKrishna-P/OS_coursework)
_As part of CS140: Operating Systems course (done as MOOC)_
* Extended kernel modules of ap uniprocessor OS named 'PintOS'.
* Implemented a priority based scheduling and wait-queue for threads.
* Implemented kernel modules for user program execution, process management and system calls.

<br/>

### Compiler for subset of C-Language
_Project was done as part of MIT:6.004 MOOC_
* Developed a Compiler for a subset of C language which converts coed into MIPS Assembly Language.
* Flex and Bison were used for Lexical analysis and parsing and the MIPS output was tested on QtSpim.

<br/>

### [Python-based Assembler, Linker and Loader](https://github.com/GopalKrishna-P/ALL_Simulator)
* Developed own Assembly language and developed code for Assembler, Linker and Loader. 
* Developed a GUI to clearly illustrates line-by-line execution of the Instructions, Memory management. 

<br/>

### [Hack Assembler](https://github.com/GopalKrishna-P/HackAssembler)
_As part of **Elements of Computation** course taught by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken_
* Developed an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code.
* Verified the output using Hack hardware platform provided in Nand-to-Tetris Software Suite.

<br/>

### Stock Prediction using Reinforcement Learning
_Mentor: Dhiraj Upadhyaya, Data Scientist, Financial Analytics Bootcamp, May - June 2018_
* Used Q-Learning methods to predict the best action to maximize the profits using Tensor flow, Keras and other popular Machine Learning libraries.

<br/>

### Trading Website (Django)
_As part of **CS50x** course taught by David J. Malan_
* Designed an trading website using Django, HTML5 & CSS.
