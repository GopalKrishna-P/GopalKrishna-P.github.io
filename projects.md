### [Bachelor Thesis Project : Fault Diagnosis of Centrifugal Pumps using Machine Learning](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtlAOL70F67mtCXTaZ?e=dgGgjq)
_Prof. Rajiv Tiwari, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Aug 2018 - Mar 2019_
* Employing different Deep Learning techniques for classifying data acquired from fault specific harmonic components vibration signals, line current, pressure, acoustic emission through sensors attached to the centrifugal pump.
* The proposed algorithm may be employed for condition based monitoring in industrial equipment reducing human engagement in real-time fault detection and decision making.

<br/>

### [Autonomous Water Sprinkler for Robotic application](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtk324mQlLS3XwNDf1?e=SntdsF)
* Developed a robot with a single sprinkler and water storage than can move through rough agricultural terrain.
* Navigation is done through Geo-fencing sensors to cover large areas without manual intervention.

### [Automated Wheelchair](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtk39kg0oiiR-3Umoa?e=Xa4quK) & [Adaptive Escalator](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtk3sSrnKSavn3JWL3?e=VzWEaJ)
_Prof. Sashindra K. Kakoty, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Jan 2016 - Mar 2016_
* Designed a cost efficient and light weight wheel chair model to climb stair case.
* Followed Machine Design Framework as taught by _Prof. S.K Kakoty_ in designing the conceptual model for the product.
* Evaluation of the concept was done by developing CAD model with Solidworks, ADAMS for statis analysis.

<br/>

### [Vibrational Analysis of Hybrid Engine](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtlAD1V8r2XZ7TqCG_?e=ZdviPg)
_Prof. S.K Dwivedy, HOD, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Oct - Nov 2017_
* Analysed and developed a mathematical model for Hybrid vehicles with IC and Electrical engines running in parallel.
* Developed a 3D Half-Car Model and stimulated its performance using ADAMs. 

<br/>

### [Dynamic Analysis of a Crane](https://1drv.ms/u/s!ApdxDjnV6wTtlAFi4_esSBHhLi8q?e=1CqVmf)
_Prof. S.K Dwivedy, HOD, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Nov 2017_
* Developed a mathematical model and analysed different configurations with constant spring stiffness and damping (Under Damped)
* Verified the same using simulations in ADAMS.

<br/>

### Compiler for subset of C-Language
_Project was done as part of MIT:6.004 MOOC_
* Developed a Compiler for a subset of C language which converts coed into MIPS Assembly Language.
* Flex and Bison were used for Lexical analysis and parsing and the MIPS output was tested on QtSpim.

<br/>

### [Python-based Assembler, Linker and Loader](https://github.com/GopalKrishna-P/ALL_Simulator)
* Developed own Assembly language and developed code for Assembler, Linker and Loader. 
* Developed a GUI to clearly illustrates line-by-line execution of the Instructions, Memory management. 

<br/>

### Stock Prediction using Reinforcement Learning
_Mentor: Dhiraj Upadhyaya, Data Scientist, Financial Analytics Bootcamp, May - June 2018_
* Used Q-Learning methods to predict the best action to maximize the profits using Tensor flow, Keras and other popular Machine Learning libraries.

<br/>

### Trading Website (Django)
_As part of **CS50x** course taught by David J. Malan_
* Designed an trading website using Django, HTML5 & CSS.
* Used javascript to dynamically modify the DOM objects.
* Used SQLite for production as databases, and interacted with databases using Ajax.

<br/>

### [Simple Physics Engine](https://github.com/GopalKrishna-P/Simple_Physics_Engine)
_As part of Computer Graphics course taught by David J. Malan_
* Implemented collision detection between sphere-to-sphere, sphere-to-triangle, and sphere-to-plane interactions
* Implemented simulation of both velocity and angular velocity for spheres along with force and torque
* Implemented spring and collision damping, also added gravity.
* Used Runge-Kutta 4th Order to integrate bodies

<br/>

### [Hack Assembler](https://github.com/GopalKrishna-P/HackAssembler)
_As part of **Elements of Computation** course taught by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken_
* Developed an Assembler program that translates programs written in the symbolic Hack assembly language into binary code.
* Verified the output using Hack hardware platform provided in Nand-to-Tetris Software Suite.

<br/>

### [Pint OS](https://github.com/GopalKrishna-P/OS_coursework)
_As part of CS140: Operating Systems course (done as MOOC)_
* Implemented a Multi-level feedback queue scheduler 
*
