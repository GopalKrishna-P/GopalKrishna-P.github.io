## Bachelor Thesis Project : Fault Diagnosis of Centrifugal Pumps using Machine Learning
_Prof. Rajiv Tiwari, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Aug 2018 - Mar 2019_
* Employing different Deep Learning techniques for classifying data acquired from fault specific harmonic components vibration signals, line current, pressure, acoustic emission through sensors attached to the centrifugal pump.
* The proposed algorithm may be employed for condition based monitoring in industrial equipment reducing human engagement in real-time fault detection and decision making.

## Autonomous Water Sprinkler for Robotic application
* Developed a robot with a single sprinkler and water storage than can move through rough agricultural terrain.
* Navigation is done through Geo-fencing sensors to cover large areas without manual intervention.

## Automated Wheelchair and Adaptive Escalator
_Prof. Sashindra K. Kakoty, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, "todo"_
* Designed a cost efficient and light weight wheel chair model to climb stair case.
* Followed Machine Design Framework as taught by _Prof. S.K Kakoty_ in designing the conceptual model for the product.
* Evaluation of the concept was done by developing CAD model with Solidworks, ADAMS for statis analysis.

## Vibrational Analysis of Hybrid Engine
_Prof. S.K Dwivedy, HOD, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Oct - Nov 2017_
* Analysed and developed a mathematical model for Hybrid vehicles with IC and Electrical engines running in parallel.
* Developed a 3D Half-Car Model and stimulated its performance using ADAMs. 

## Design and Stimulation of Autonomous Vacuum Cleaner
_Prof. Sashindra K. Kakoty, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Jan 2016 - Mar 2016_
* Used Machine Design framework to design several models depending upon the use case.
* Designed a working prototypes for which the CAD was developed in SolidWorks and static
structural analysis (FEA) was done using ANSYS workbench.

## Dynamic Analysis of a Crane
_Prof. S.K Dwivedy, HOD, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Guwahati, Nov 2017_
* Developed a mathematical model and analysed different configurations with constant spring stiffness and damping (Under Damped)
* Verified the same using simulations in ADAMS.

## Stock Prediction using Reinforcement Learning
_Mentor: Dhiraj Upadhyaya, Data Scientist, Financial Analytics Bootcamp, May - June 2018_
* Used Q-Learning methods to predict the best action to maximize the profits using Tensor flow, Keras and other popular Machine Learning libraries.

## Compiler for subset of C-Language
_Project was done as part of MIT:6.004 MOOC_
* Developed a Compiler for a subset of C language which converts coed into MIPS Assembly Language.
* Flex and Bison were used for Lexical analysis and parsing and the MIPS output was tested on QtSpim.

## Python-based Assembler, Linker and Loader

[_GitHub Repo_](https://github.com/GopalKrishna-P/ALL_Simulator)
- Developed own Assembly language and developed code for Assembler, Linker and Loader. 
- Developed a GUI to clearly illustrates line-by-line execution of the Instructions, Memory management.
